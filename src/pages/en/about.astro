        Have you ever been so captivated by something that you couldn't turn away from it?
      </p>

      <p>
        For me, that's Japanese Studies, through which I explore Japanese culture, language, literature, and nature, constantly discovering new aspects of its aesthetics. I'm particularly fascinated by the intertwining of culture and language, which presents itself impressively in research on Japan and the Japanese language.
      </p>

      <p>
        My research interests are grounded in a deep fascination with <em>bunpō</em> (Japanese grammar), <em>bungo</em> (Classical Japanese), the interweaving of language and culture, semantics, and the development of Japanese writing systems. Furthermore, I conduct research in the field of Cognitive Linguistics and Philosophy of Language. I investigate how emotions are interwoven in Japanese language and culture within my dissertation.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy spending time with family, writing <em>haiku</em>, reading novels and short stories, and occasionally relaxing with anime and manga. I also enjoy discovering cultural references and making them accessible to others. One winter, a patient of my husband's at a palliative care unit lent me her personal haiku collection, which continues to deeply shape me and reminds me how fragile and precious our encounters are.
      </p>

      <p>I consider myself fortunate to be able to delight in the diversity of Japanese culture anew every day.</p>
